 `-atomic {-tmp <tmp_dir>}` | Specify atomic commit, with optional tmp directory. | `-atomic` instructs DistCp to copy the source data to a temporary target location, and then move the temporary target to the final-location atomically. Data will either be available at final target in a complete and consistent form, or not at all. Optionally, `-tmp` may be used to specify the location of the tmp-target. If not specified, a default is chosen. **Note:** tmp_dir must be on the final target cluster.
 `-mapredSslConf <ssl_conf_file>` | Specify SSL Config file, to be used with HSFTP source | When using the hsftp protocol with a source, the security- related properties may be specified in a config-file and passed to DistCp. \<ssl_conf_file\> needs to be in the classpath.
 `-async` | Run DistCp asynchronously. Quits as soon as the Hadoop Job is launched. | The Hadoop Job-id is logged, for tracking.
-`-diff <fromSnapshot> <toSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify the difference between source and target. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. 1. Both the source and target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem. 2. Two snapshots (e.g., s1 and s2) have been created on the source FS. The diff between these two snapshots will be copied to the target FS. 3. The target has the same snapshot s1. No changes have been made on the target since s1. All the files/directories in the target are the same with source.s1. |
+`-diff <oldSnapshot> <newSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify the difference between source and target, and apply the diff to the target to make it in sync with source. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. <ol><li> Both the source and the target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem.</li> <li> Two snapshots `<oldSnapshot>` and `<newSnapshot>` have been created on the source FS, and `<oldSnapshot>` is older than `<newSnapshot>`. </li> <li> The target has the same snapshot `<oldSnapshot>`.

The source and the target can be two different clusters/paths, or they can be exactly the same cluster/path.
